I have written all the comments and and foundation for the code. Specifically, I have used Copilot for four of the def functions, such as def load_data(file_path: str):, def clean_column_names(df):def handle_missing_values(df):, def remove_invalid_rows(df):. Moreover, Copilot did primarily of its job in here. It has generated the code and debugg it at the same time. The prompts that I used for copilot are the comment that I have noted down above each function.

Although most of my code is accomplished perfectly by copilot. I barely found a mistakes, but I eventually found one. Specifically, The Copilot has changed the quantity in datafram, but it keeps it as the float type. This is impossible to happen in real life if we consider a perfect item. Therefore, I has change it to integer.

Finally, I have learned that Datacleaning is actually easy if we distribute the steps into simple steps, such as looking for missing values, class, sign, and more. Moreover, the most thing that I have learnt is the use of Copilot. I did not even know that we can use Copilot before this assignment. The strength of copilot is significantly useful, such as creating the function based on my description. However, it is limited by creating simple code and avoid detail information like negative sign when I was trying to do the missing_value function
